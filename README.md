# Lucky Chain Slot Machine

## Project Overview
**Lucky Chain Slot Machine** is an interactive slot machine game that uses **Markov Chain** principles to simulate state-dependent probabilities. The game allows players to place bets, spin the slot machine, and aim to hit a jackpot while tracking their statistics such as winnings, losses, and jackpot hits in real-time. The game combines fun gameplay with a robust backend to track player behavior and provide meaningful visualizations.

### Key Features:
- **Markov Chain-Based Slot Machine**: Each spinâ€™s outcome is determined by the Markov Chain, influencing the probability of landing on specific symbols.
- **Player Profiles and Management**: Players can log in, top up their balance, place bets, and spin the slot machine, with their balance and stats saved across sessions.
- **Jackpot System**: A rare jackpot can be triggered by landing on a specific combination of symbols, providing excitement and increasing engagement.
- **Data Tracking and Visualization**: Player stats such as wins, losses, jackpots, and balance are tracked and visualized in graphs for better insights.
- **Responsive and Clean UI**: A user-friendly interface that makes the game accessible to players of all experience levels.
